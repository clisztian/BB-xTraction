The Blakely-Brugger method is a quantitative sparse predictive hierarchy for learning and prediction in microfossil structures. 
The method introduces a discretization approach using a sparse distrubuted representation of the Brugger extraction method (Brugger et al. 2018) which allows vegetation, fire and land-use activity reconstructions on broad spatial scales.

This repository serves as the main code written in Java 9 with JavaFX interface.
